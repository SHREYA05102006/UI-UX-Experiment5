# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To identify user pain points, write clear UX problem statements, choose appropriate research methods, and create user personas for two apps—a Student Habit Tracker App and an E-Commerce Clothing App

## Algorithm:
1.Select scenarios: Choose the two apps: Student Habit Tracker App and E-Commerce Clothing App.

2.Gather initial observations: Review screenshots or example apps; jot common user complaints (confusing navigation, too many steps to track habits or complete purchases).

3.Identify pain points: List concrete user problems for each scenario.

4.Write problem statements: Use the template:

"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

5.Choose research methods: Pick methods per scenario (e.g., interviews, usability testing, surveys, A/B testing) and write brief justifications.

6.Create personas: Craft at least two personas (demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, motivation) representing typical users.


## Output:
### Scenario 1: Student Habit Tracker App

The app helps students track daily habits like study time, exercise, sleep, and other activities.

#### Observed User Problems:

Students forget to track habits due to lack of reminders.

Interface may be confusing with too many elements on one screen.

No simple progress overview for multiple habits.

#### Problem Statement:
Students need a way to track their daily habits easily because current apps are confusing and overwhelming, which results in missed tracking and low motivation.

#### Selected Research Methods:

##### Surveys: To understand which habits students want to track and their preferences for reminders.

##### Usability Testing: To observe students interacting with the app prototype and identify confusing elements.

### Expected Outcome:
The UX designer can simplify the interface, provide clear tracking progress, and include reminders to improve habit adherence.

### Scenario 2: E-Commerce Clothing App

The app allows users to browse, filter, and purchase clothing items easily.

#### Observed User Problems:

Difficulty finding products due to poor filtering options.

Confusing navigation between categories and product details.

Checkout process is too lengthy and not intuitive.

#### Problem Statement:
Users need a way to browse and purchase clothing items efficiently because current apps are hard to navigate, which results in frustration and abandoned carts.

#### Selected Research Methods:

##### Interviews: To collect feedback on navigation and product search experience.

##### A/B Testing: To compare two layouts for category navigation and checkout flow.

#### Expected Outcome:
The UX designer can improve filtering options, simplify navigation, and optimize the checkout process to enhance user satisfaction and reduce cart abandonment.
